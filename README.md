# windows-wallpaper-randomizer
#### _Small script to randomize wallpaper on windows 10 based machines_

This script was made to make it easier to distinguish different sessions when working with multiple remote desktop instances by assigning them a different wallpaper.

## Example
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31797203/176733719-eb35f09b-4d7a-4027-9e22-9e26210f9f52.png" width="512" height="288" />

## How is wallpaper generated?
- ip address is read automatically
- resolution of the wallpaper is read from currently used 
- background and ip adresses colors are random
- proportions are hardcoded

Sometimes you will need to run script several times to get something bearable ðŸ™ˆ
